# Code the Future 2025 - Cmple

AI model training on different shapes using the Raspberry Pi 5, assisted by the Braccio robotic arm controlled by an STM32 board.  
Includes **speech-to-text** to start the recognition process.

---

##  What Weâ€™ve Implemented

-  Custom Braccio library for the STM32 development board in low-level C.
-  AI model training using TensorFlow Lite (floating-point model conversion)  
-  Simple communication protocol between Raspberry Pi and STM32  
-  **Speech-to-text** module to trigger recognition processes

##  Usage

1. Create a new branch from the `main` branch.  
2. Add your changes **inside your team folder**.  
3. When your project is complete, **submit a pull request**.

---

##  Rules

1. **Branch Naming:** Your branch must include your **team name**.
2. **Commit Style:** Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
3. **Push Frequency:** Push your changes **at least once every hour**.

##  Notes

- Make sure the speech-to-text module is properly set up before testing the recognition process.
- For questions or issues, open an issue in the repository or contact the maintainers.
